# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

  The purpose of this analysis was to find out how many employees at the company Pewlett-Hachard are getting ready to retire. As the baby boomer generation ages, they more or less all getting ready to retire all at the same time, so the company has to prepare to replace these people or change the way they operate. The Sales and Developement departments have also purposed a solution to the possible shortage of qualified workers by purposing a Mentorship Program to have soon to be retired to pass on their knowledge to the next generation of workers and do so while working only part-time.

## Results:

Major take-aways from this analysis are:

- The total number of eligible mentors is only 1,548 out of the 90,397 employees that are about the retire.
- The majority of the soon-to-be retirees are the Senior level engineer, with "Senoir Staff" at a close second.
- The highest number of soon-to-be retirees are form the Developement Department, with the Production Department as a close second.
- Pewlett Hackard needs to start hiring because, a total of 90,398 or 30.1% of the employees are near or at retirment age.
